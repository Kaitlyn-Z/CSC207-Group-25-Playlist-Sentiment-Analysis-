That's an excellent question. You're thinking about the security of your Spotify account, which is important.

The short answer is that the application itself cannot deactivate the token or your session on Spotify's servers. The "Log Out" button in the app only deletes the app's local copy of the login information.

To completely and truly deactivate the application's access to your Spotify account, you must do it from your Spotify account settings. This is the standard and most secure method for all third-party Spotify apps.

Here’s how you can do it:

1.  **Log in to the Spotify Website**: Open a web browser and go to `https://www.spotify.com/account/`.
2.  **Go to Your Account Page**: Log in if you aren't already.
3.  **Find the "Apps" Page**: In the left-hand menu, click on **"Apps"**. You can also go there directly by visiting `https://www.spotify.com/account/apps/`.
4.  **Revoke Access**: You will see a list of all third-party applications that you have given permission to access your Spotify account. Find the application you created for this project in the list and click the **"REMOVE ACCESS"** button next to it.

Once you do this, the connection is completely severed. The next time you (or the app) try to use the stored tokens, Spotify will reject the request because you have revoked the permission. To use the app again, you would have to go through the full login and authorization process from the beginning.
